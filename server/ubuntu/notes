Server name "gayflower", but you'll have to connect using the IP address 192.168.66.1 because there is no DNS while offline.

User "spolsky"
password is printed on the server

sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled
sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
sudo systemctl mask  systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

Running pm2 to keep node running and serving index.js across reboots
index.js located in /home/spolsky

  $ sudo pm2 list
  -- to see it running

Installed dnsmasq to do DHCP (apt install dnsmasq)


The server can switch between "offline" and "online" mode
offline - no internet, normal daily use
    DHCP server runs to give out IP addresses to clients
    static IP 192.168.66.1
online - gets the server on the internet, ethernet hard link, for updates etc
    does not run its own DHCP server, expects to get everything from a physically connected router

offline/online shell scripts are the same file, linked to each other with ln 
so sudo ./offline goes offline, sudo ./online goes online
